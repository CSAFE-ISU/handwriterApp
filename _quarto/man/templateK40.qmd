## Cluster Template with Forty Clusters {.unnumbered}


### Description

A list containing a single cluster template created by
<code>handwriter::make_clustering_template</code>. The cluster template was created
by sorting graphs from 120 training documents into 40 clusters with a K-means
algorithm. The training documents are from the CSAFE Handwriting Database: 50
Wizard of Oz prompts, 50 London Letter prompts, and 20 common phrase prompts.
Each prompt is from a distinct writer.



### Usage

<pre><code class='language-R'>templateK40
</code></pre>


### Format

The cluster template is a named list with 16 items:


<dl>
<dt>centers_seed</dt><dd>The integer use for the random number generator to select starting cluster centers.
</dd>
<dt>cluster</dt><dd>A vector of cluster assignments
for each graph used to create the cluster template.
</dd>
<dt>centers</dt><dd>The final cluster centers produced by the K-Means algorithm.
</dd>
<dt>K</dt><dd>The number of clusters.
</dd>
<dt>n</dt><dd>The number of training graphs to used in the K-means
algorithm.
</dd>
<dt>docnames</dt><dd>A vector that lists the training document from which each graph originated.
</dd>
<dt>writers</dt><dd>A vector that lists the writer ID of each graph.
</dd>
<dt>iters</dt><dd>The maximum number of iterations of the K-means
algorithm.
</dd>
<dt>changes</dt><dd>A vector of the number of graphs that
changed clusters on each iteration of the K-means algorithm.
</dd>
<dt>outlierCutoff</dt><dd>A vector of the outlier cutoff values calculated on
each iteration of the K-means algorithm.
</dd>
<dt>stop_reason</dt><dd>The reason the
K-means algorithm terminated.
</dd>
<dt>wcd</dt><dd>A matrix of the within cluster
distances on the last iteration of the K-means algorithm. More specifically,
the distance between each graph and the center of the cluster to which it
was assigned  on each iteration.
</dd>
<dt>wcss</dt><dd>A vector of the
within-cluster sum of squares on each iteration of the K-means algorithm.
</dd></dl>
